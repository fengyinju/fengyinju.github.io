# Biography

Currently I am an Assistant Researcher in Software Institute at Nanjing University. Before joining Nanjing Univeristy in 2023, I received my Ph.D. degree in Software Engineering from Nanjing University in 2022, and B.Sc. Degree in Computer Science from Central South University in 2017.
My research interests include Natural Language Processing and Legal AI.

Our team is actively looking for PhD, master, and undergraduate students with strong interests in NLP or SE. If you are interested, feel free to contact me. [Team Homepage](http://liplab.site/).
